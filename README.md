# Hi there! I'm Danil Klimov 👋

**Frontend Developer** with a focus on performance, maintainability, and business logic.
Currently working at a web studio, dealing with legacy refactoring and high-load optimizations.

> ⚠️ **Note on Activity:** Most of my commercial work happens in private **GitLab** repositories. My GitHub is for pet projects and experiments.

## 🛠 What I Do

I don't just close tickets — I try to understand *why* we are building this feature and how to make it efficient.

* **Commercial Experience:** Currently at **Dancecolor**. My daily routine involves modernizing legacy code (Native JS + Bitrix), setting up build processes (Gulp/Webpack), and optimizing frontend performance (recently cut CSS bundle size by 88% and implemented custom resource managers).
* **Pet Projects:** I use my free time to build clean, typed architectures using **React** and **TypeScript**, experimenting with modern stacks.
* **Background:** I have prior experience in UI/UX Design and System Administration. This helps me speak the same language with designers and backend developers.

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Core (Frontend):**
* **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript
* **Frameworks:** React, Tailwind CSS
* **Tools:** Gulp, Vite, Git, Figma (Advanced), BEM, SCSS

**Background & Hobbies (I know the basics):**
* **Backend:** Python, PHP, SQL
* **3D & Design:** Blender, Photoshop, Illustrator (Good understanding of composition and asset preparation)
* **Scripting:** Bash/Python automation
